# Predicting-leukoplakia-and-oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma-using-interpretable-machine-learning.-
This project aims predicting leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma using interpretable machine learning.. The model is built using the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn and is evaluated on several performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, splitting the data into training and test sets, and feature scaling.

# Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values and feature scaling.
Modeling: Utilizes RandomForestClassifier for prediction.
Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be accessed https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bbmmm4wgr8/4.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
shap
# How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the notebook Oral_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb to train the model and evaluate its performance.
